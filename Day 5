Return the maximum possible profit.

Problem Constraints
0 <= A.size() <= 700000

1 <= A[i] <= 107

Input Format
The first and the only argument is an array of integers, A.

Output Format
Return an integer, representing the maximum possible profit.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2]
Input 2:

A = [1, 4, 5, 2, 4]

Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:

4

User Code

 public class Solution {
    // DO NOT MODIFY THE ARGUMENTS WITH "final" PREFIX. IT IS READ ONLY
    public int maxProfit(final int[] A) {
        if(A.length == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int buy_price = A[0];
        int profit = 0;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < A.length; i++){
            // current < buy_price
            if(A[i] < buy_price){
                buy_price = A[i];
            }else if (A[i] - buy_price > profit){ // difference b/w current and buy price greater than profit
                profit = A[i] - buy_price;
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
